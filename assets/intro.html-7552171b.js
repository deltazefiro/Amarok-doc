However, many of these encryptors are slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. While these solutions may be secure, they are often overkill for the average user who simply wants to prevent others from accidentally accessing their private files and apps.</p><p>Amarok is designed specifically for these situations, as it is a lightweight file and app &quot;hider&quot;. Amarok only obscures filenames and file signatures, making files unreadable to humans, and this process can be done almost instantly regardless of the size of the file. Additionally, it &quot;disables&quot; apps, effectively hiding them from the launcher. All of these functions can be accomplished with just one click.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TL;DR</p><ul><li>Amarok obscures filenames and file signatures, making files unreadable.</li><li>Amarok &quot;disables&quot; apps to hide them from the launcher.</li></ul></div><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Features</h2><ul><li>High-speed Large File Hiding: Obfuscate filenames and file signatures to make files unreadable.</li><li>Non-root Application Hiding: Make apps invisible on the launcher.
